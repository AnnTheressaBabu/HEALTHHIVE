### Project Description
Health hive is a comprehensive website designed to help users monitor health matrices.


### The Problem statement

The problem is that, despite the availability of BMI calculators, many of them offer only the BMI value without providing any actionable advice or tailored suggestions for improving health, diet, or fitness. 
This leaves individuals without the guidance they need to take the next steps toward improving their health.

### The Solution
The main features are user registration, inputting height and weight, BMI calculation and personalized suggestions.
